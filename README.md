# Game-Foundation
A base project to build game upon without wasting too much time on settings, main menu, etc

It is mostly base on my work for Ishid-O-Matic Reborn game so it might be a bit too specific for now and it will be improve over time with the main focus is 2D games only and settings will show this choice.
